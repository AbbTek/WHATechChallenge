# WHATechChallenge

The project was developed using Visual Studio 2015, and it should compile without issues, you only need to check that the current user for the process has right to write in the folder App_Data because the system creates the temporary CSV files in this folder.

The system keeps the information from the files using a few static variables; there is no persistence for this version. For this software, I have used the following technologies: Microsoft .NET, WebApi, AngularJS, MVC, Bootstrap, Linq, JSon among others. 

In the following URL, you can test the system http://ec2-52-62-19-253.ap-southeast-2.compute.amazonaws.com/
